# 2D-Platformer-Game

Welcome and thank you for your interest in my repository! This is the first game I've developed; it's made in Unity and marks my initial experience with that technology and the C# language. It was a very enjoyable and enriching experience, and I hope you enjoy the game!


## Installation

To play my game, first you have to clone this repository (This game is compatible only with Windows).

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/akhoz/2D-Platformer-Game.git

```
Then, go ahead and open the game.exe file that is in build directory and start enjoying!

```bash
  cd 2D-Platformer-Game/
  cd build/
  ./game.exe
```
